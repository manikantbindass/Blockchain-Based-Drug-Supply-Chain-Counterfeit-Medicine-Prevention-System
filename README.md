# Blockchain-Based-Drug-Supply-Chain-Counterfeit-Medicine-Prevention-System
A blockchain-powered drug supply chain platform that prevents counterfeit medicines by enabling end-to-end batch traceability from manufacturer to consumer. Uses Hyperledger/Ethereum, QR verification, and AI-based anomaly detection to ensure authenticity, transparency, and regulatory compliance.
## From factory to pharmacy, every pill tells the truth.
## Blockchain locks authenticity.
## AI hunts anomalies.
## Counterfeit medicines stop here.

A **blockchain-powered, AI-enabled drug traceability platform** designed to eliminate counterfeit and substandard medicines by ensuring **end-to-end transparency, authenticity, and regulatory control** across the pharmaceutical supply chain.

---

## Problem Statement

Counterfeit and substandard medicines pose a serious threat to public health, particularly in large and complex pharmaceutical supply chains.  
Key challenges include:
- Lack of end-to-end traceability from manufacturer to consumer  
- Difficulty in verifying medicine authenticity at each handover  
- Limited visibility for regulators to monitor and recall compromised batches  
- High risk of tampering during distribution and last-mile delivery  

---

## 💡Solution Overview

This project introduces a **permissioned blockchain-based supply chain system** integrated with **AI-driven anomaly detection and computer vision** to track, verify, and authenticate medicines at every stage of their lifecycle.

Each medicine batch is assigned a **unique blockchain identity**, and every transfer is recorded as an immutable transaction.  
AI models continuously monitor the system to detect suspicious behavior, while QR/DataMatrix codes allow **instant verification** by pharmacies, hospitals, and consumers.

##  System Architecture

### 🔗 Blockchain Layer
- Permissioned blockchain (Hyperledger Fabric)
- Immutable ledger for batch creation and transfers
- Smart contracts for:
  - Batch registration
  - Ownership transfer
  - Recall and freeze operations
  - Regulatory audits
- IPFS for storing certificates and compliance documents

### 🖥️ Application Layer
- Web dashboard for manufacturers, distributors, regulators
- Mobile apps for pharmacies, hospitals, and consumers
- Role-based access control (RBAC)

### 🤖 AI & Analytics Layer
- Anomaly detection for routes, time delays, and quantity mismatches
- Graph-based analysis to identify suspicious supply chain patterns
- Computer vision for packaging, QR code, and seal verification

---

## Supply Chain Workflow

1. Manufacturer registers a new medicine batch on the blockchain  
2. QR/DataMatrix code generated and printed on packaging  
3. Each handover is scanned and recorded as a blockchain transaction  
4. AI models monitor transactions in real time for anomalies  
5. Pharmacies and hospitals verify authenticity before dispensing  
6. Consumers scan QR codes to verify medicine origin and journey  
7. Regulators can freeze, recall, or audit batches instantly
